## Installation:

1. Using a T30 torx bit, remove the 3 torx bolts from the driver door bracket. Let the bracket hang by the cable.
![3-drivers-stock-bracket.jpg](../images/1-drivers-stock-bracket.jpg)

2. Prepare the driver door bracket by installing three M6 x 25mm cap head allen bolts with washers and M6 x 8mm spacers as shown.
![4-drivers-door-gas-strut-bracket-fasteners.jpg](../images/2-drivers-door-gas-strut-bracket-fasteners.jpg)

3. Install the driver door bracket as shown. Tighten the bolts enough that the factory bracket is held in place, but can move. Close the door completely, allowing the factory bracket to self align using the factory pin on the body side. Open the door and tighten the bolts down further.
![3-drivers-door-gas-strut-bracket-fasteners-installed.jpg](../images/3-drivers-door-gas-strut-bracket-fasteners-installed.jpg)

4. Install one 10mm ball stud with spacer as shown.
![4-drivers-door-gas-strut-bracket-ball-stud-installed.jpg](../images/4-drivers-door-gas-strut-bracket-ball-stud-installed.jpg)

5. Using a T30 torx bit, remove the 2 torx bolts from the passenger door bracket. Temporarily remove the factory bracket.
![5-passenger-door-stock-bracket.jpg](../images/5-passenger-door-stock-bracket.jpg)

6. Using 2 M6 x 18mm cap head allen bolts and washers, install the passenger door bracket as shown. Again, tighten the bolts enough that the factory bracket is held in place, but can move. First, close the driver's door completely, then close the passenger door completely, allowing the factory bracket to self align using the factory pin on the body side. Open the door and tighten the bolts down further.
![6-passenger-door-gas-strut-bracket-installed.jpg](../images/6-passenger-door-gas-strut-bracket-installed.jpg)

7. Install one 10mm ball stud with spacer as shown.
![7-drivers-door-gas-strut-bracket-ball-stud-installed.jpg](../images/7-drivers-door-gas-strut-bracket-ball-stud-installed.jpg)

8. Align the driver body side bracket as shown. This bracket will serve as a mounting point for one end of the gas strut as well as a cover for the factory plastic that will be cut in the next step.
![8-drivers-side-align-body-side-bracket.jpg](../images/8-drivers-side-align-body-side-bracket.jpg)

9. There are likely a few ways to accomplish the next step. While developing this kit, I marked where I wanted to cut, then completely removed the factory plastic cover, clamped it lightly in my bench vice and used an oscillating tool to cut the plastic. It is likely possible to release one (or a few) of the plastic square clips to lift part of the plastic cover and cut it in place. Another option, if you have or purchase larger drill bits, would be to drill three holes that are large enough to allow access to drill holes in the body and install the rivet nuts; this is likely the least intrusive option, but is untested. Note: To prevent the exposed metal from rusting, it is recommended to prime/paint the exposed metal before installing these rivet nuts.

10. Align one M6 x 8mm spacer with the rivet nut closest to the middle of the van. Align two M6 x 10mm spacers with the remaining two rivet nuts.
![10-drivers-body-side-bracket-align-spacers.jpg](../images/10-drivers-body-side-bracket-align-spacers.jpg)

11. Install one 10mm ball stud and washer as shown.
![11-drivers-body-side-bracket-ball-stud-installed.jpg](../images/11-drivers-body-side-bracket-ball-stud-installed.jpg)

12. Prepare the driver body side bracket by installing three M6 x 25mm cap head allen bolts with washers as shown.
![12-drivers-body-side-bracket-fasteners.jpg](../images/12-drivers-body-side-bracket-fasteners.jpg)

13. Align the driver body side bracket and the M6 x 25mm cap head bolts with the spacers. Using the 4mm allen wrench, tighten the bolts enough that the bracket is held in place, but can move. I would not recommended using power tools with rivet nuts, if anything is misaligned it will likely ruin your day. 
![13-drivers-body-side-bracket-fasteners-aligned.jpg](../images/13-drivers-body-side-bracket-fasteners-aligned.jpg)

14. Align the bracket to best cover any gaps.
![14-drivers-body-side-bracket-push-to-cover-gap.jpg](../images/14-drivers-body-side-bracket-push-to-cover-gap.jpg)

15. Tighten the bolts down further.
![15-drivers-body-side-bracket-fasteners-installed.jpg](../images/15-drivers-body-side-bracket-fasteners-installed.jpg)

16. Set the extension end of the gas strut on top of the ball stud.
![16-drivers-body-side-bracket-before-install-gas-strut.jpg](../images/16-drivers-body-side-bracket-before-install-gas-strut.jpg)

17. Press down firmly to install.
![17-drivers-body-side-bracket-install-gas-strut.jpg](../images/17-drivers-body-side-bracket-install-gas-strut.jpg)

18. Move the gas strut out of the way as shown.
![18-drivers-body-side-bracket-move-gas-strut-to-the-side.jpg](../images/18-drivers-body-side-bracket-move-gas-strut-to-the-side.jpg)

19. Close the driver's door slightly.
![19-drivers-side-door-limiter.jpg](../images/19-drivers-side-door-limiter.jpg)

20. Pull in on the door limiter.
![20-drivers-side-door-limiter-before-release.jpg](../images/20-drivers-side-door-limiter-before-release.jpg)

21. Once the door limiter is moved to the side, open the driver's door slightly.
![21-drivers-side-door-limiter-release.jpg](../images/21-drivers-side-door-limiter-release.jpg)

22. Align the body end of the gas strut with the driver's door ball stud.
![22-drivers-door-side-gas-strut-before-install.jpg](../images/22-drivers-door-side-gas-strut-before-install.jpg)

23. Press down firmly to install.
![23-drivers-door-side-gas-strut-installed.jpg](../images/23-drivers-door-side-gas-strut-installed.jpg)

24. Close the driver's door until you hear the door limiter make an audible clunk noise.
![24-drivers-side-door-limiter-before-reset.jpg](../images/24-drivers-side-door-limiter-before-reset.jpg)

25. Then allow the gas strut to push the door open.
![25-drivers-side-door-limiter-reset.jpg](../images/25-drivers-side-door-limiter-reset.jpg)

26. Your driver's door gas strut is now installed!
![26-drivers-door-gas-strut-installed-open.jpg](../images/26-drivers-door-gas-strut-installed-open.jpg)

27. Repeat steps 8-26 for the passenger side.

## Gotchas:
1. If you finish installing your rivet nuts and they are not perfectly aligned, you can take a small circular metal file (or something similar) and file away a small bit of aluminum from the body side brackets.
2. If you need to remove the gas struts, you can use a small flat head screwdriver to pop the clip off the end of the gas strut. Insert the flathead screw driver under the clip, progressively pry up more on the clip, while lifting up on the gas strut and wiggling back and forth until the gas strut releases.

![PXL_20240930_173214846.PORTRAIT.jpg](../images/PXL_20240930_173214846.PORTRAIT.jpg)
3. If the clip on the end of the gas strut pops loose. You can insert something big enough to help pry it back, in this case I used an allen wrench. Insert the allen wrench into the whole, rotate the top of the allen towards the side with the clip stuck too far through while pressing down on the clip from the top, the clip should pop back into place.

![PXL_20240930_173329252.jpg](../images/PXL_20240930_173329252.jpg)
4. If you have trouble with a rivet nut and need to remove it, you can use something like a 45 degree countersink bit in a drill to remove the top of the rivet nut, which splits the rivet nut into two pieces releasing it from the hole it was installed in.
