6. On the underside of the induction cooktop, remove the four machine screws (these will be used later) between the induction cooktop bracket and the induction cooktop, then remove four screws between the induction cooktop bracket and the kitchen galley. Remove the induction cooktop.

7. **If you don't feel comfortable with this step, hire an electrician. I am not an electrician, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.** For outlets in the 2018-2020 Revels, there should be only two outlet circuits; one 15 amp circuit for all the outlets in the van except the induction cooktop outlet and one 20 amp circuit for the induction cooktop outlet. In my install, I replaced the induction cooktop outlet (which surprisingly was a 15 amp outlet, I believe this was a mistake on Winnebago's side) with a residential 20 amp outlet; this is a 20 amp circuit, everything on it should be rated for 20 amps. I switched to an outlet that allows me to run the induction cooktop and microwave off the same outlet. It may be possible to mount the 15 amp outlet that is on the front right of the kitchen galley somewhere inside the kitchen galley to avoid adjusting this circuit. It is also possible to do this and connect the microwave to that circuit. I personally removed this outlet (front right of kitchen galley), but this required me to run a new 14/2 w/ ground from the outlet on the front left of the kitchen galley to the outlets on the passenger side rear of the van, in order to do this you have to remove the lower big plastic panel next to the bed on the passenger side of the van and in order to remove the lower you have to remove the upper plastic panel.

8. You will need to cut an opening for the microwave. I would recommend first marking a line for the opening and conservatively remove material. You can always remove more material, but you can't add it back. I cut near the line and then later used a palm sander to remove more where needed. Here are some rough dimensions. The left cut will be `1/8 in` (`3.175 mm`) to the right of the cut for the fridge. The right cut will line up with the inner brace of the kitchen galley which is a little under `3/4 in` (`18.6 mm`) from the pantry wall. The top cut will be `1 5/16 in` (`33.5 mm`) below the countertop. You will also need to remove the majority of the front right inner brace. The bumpout on the right side of the microwave near the front ends up in this space.

9. Install the rear vent. Mark the four outer mounting holes. Mark the corners of the top and bottom vent openings and then drawer a line between each corner to form a rectangle of the area you need to remove. You will likely need ot use an oscillating tool to cut this opening. If you are able to use a jigsaw, I would recommend drilling each corner using a drill bit larger than the width of your jigsaw blade.

10. Prepare the bottle jack.

11. Align the microwave shelf.

![19-align-microwave-shelf.jpg](2018-2020-Winnebago-Revel-Kitchen-Galley-Microwave-Install-Instructions-images/19-align-microwave-shelf.jpg)

12. Begin test fitting the microwave.

13. Be sure the power cable is clear.

14. Check alignment on the right and top, if you need to remove more material, I would recommend using a palm sander.

![23-check-alignment-top.jpg](2018-2020-Winnebago-Revel-Kitchen-Galley-Microwave-Install-Instructions-images/23-check-alignment-top.jpg)

15. Use screw slots so that you can temporary mount the shelf, allowing you to test fit the fridge. Align the screws so that they do not miss the support board.

16. Remove the bottle jack.

17. Test fit the fridge. This is a tight fit. The fridge will likely bind some, be sure the fridge is going in square; you may need to press from the top and the bottom and wiggle it in.

28. Remove the microwave and drill pilot holes for the microwave bezel mounting holes. Use a drill bit that is equal to or slightly smaller than the diameter of the screw shank (not the threads).
